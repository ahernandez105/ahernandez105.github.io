Summary: HERE IS A SUMMARY OF THIS POST

If you're a working data scientist then you have likely heard of Variational Autoencoders and their interesting applications in data generation. There are a fair amount of posts about VAEs, but most brush over the statistical derivation and focus on the high-level intuition and applications. While the statistical make-up can come off as intimidating, I firmly believe grasping the core mathematical concepts acts as an excellent exercise and is must for any aspiring machine learning researcher. As a result, I will do my best to open up VAEs with an emphasis on the statistical components, while still guiding the qualitative intuition.

At its core, Variational Autoencoders are 

# Mehthodology and Derivation
Like all generative models, VAEs are concerned with learning a valid probablity over a given dataset $\mathcal{D}$.
