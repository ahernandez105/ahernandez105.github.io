Hernandez and I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University focusing my studies in machine learning. I am also a recipient of the Science Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) Fellowship, where upon graduation I will be an engineer for the army adhereing to initiatives in warfare simulation modeling at the TRADOC Analysis Center. I have found machine learning blog posts to be an excellent resource during my academic studies and I hope mine can be as beneficial to you as some of ones I have linked below.</description><lastBuildDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2017 12:30:00 -0500</lastBuildDate><item><title>My first post</title><link>/MY%20FIRST%20POST.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;HERE IS A SUMMARY OF THIS POST&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Angel C.
