Hernandez and I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University focusing my studies in machine learning. I am also a recipient of the Science Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) Fellowship, where upon graduation I will be an engineer for the army adhereing to initiatives in warfare simulation modeling at the TRADOC Analysis Center. I have found machine learning blog posts to be an excellent resource during my academic studies and I hope mine can be as beneficial to you as some of ones I have linked below.</subtitle><entry><title>My first post</title><link href="MY%20FIRST%20POST.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-26T10:01:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-27T12:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Angel C.

There are a fair amount of posts about VAEs, but most brush over the statistical derivation and focus on the high-level intuition and applications. While the statistical make-up can come off as intimidating, I firmly believe grasping the core mathematical concepts acts as an excellent exercise and is must for any aspiring machine learning researcher. As a result, I will do my best to open up VAEs with an emphasis on the statistical components, while still guiding the qualitative intuition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contemporary feedback is vital for lucid blog posts, so comments of mistakes, likes and/or dislikes is greatly appreciated. :)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Variational Autoencoders are &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mehthodology and Derivation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all generative models, VAEs are concerned with learning a valid probablity over a given dataset $\mathcal{D}$.&lt;br&gt;
